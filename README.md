# 🌱 Curious Full Stack Journey
**Learning Java + React + Microservices through real problems, not theory.**  
A 30-day hands-on journey to become a curious, confident full stack developer 🚀  

---

## 🧭 About This Project
This repository documents my personal journey to master **Full Stack Development** using:
- **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot  
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind / Bootstrap  
- **Architecture:** Microservices  
- **Database:** MySQL / MongoDB  

Rather than following long tutorials, I solve one **real-world problem per day**, learning concepts as I go.

## 📅 30-Day Problem-Driven Plan

| Day | Project / Problem | Concepts Learned |
|-----|-------------------|------------------|
| 1 | Hello User API (React ↔ Spring Boot) | REST APIs, CORS, Fetch |
| 2 | Notes App (Create + Read) | CRUD Basics, useState, useEffect |
| 3 | Update & Delete Notes | PUT, DELETE, State updates |
| 4 | Connect with Database (MySQL) | JPA, Repository layer |
| 5 | Add Validation & Error Handling | @Valid, Exception Handling |
| ... | ... | ... |
| 30 | Deploy Microservices + React | Docker, AWS / Render Deployment |

*(Updating daily as I learn and build!)*

## 🧠 My Learning Philosophy
> “Don’t memorize concepts — build something that makes you curious enough to learn them.”

Every problem in this repo started with a *why*:
- “Why does the browser need CORS?”
- “How does React know when to re-render?”
- “Why do microservices talk over REST instead of sharing databases?”

## 💭 Reflection Log
*(Updated daily to capture thoughts and discoveries)*  
🗓️ **Day 1:** Learned how frontend and backend connect via REST. The first “Hello” felt magical!  
🗓️ **Day 2:** Building CRUD in full stack gave me a real sense of control. I finally “saw” the data flow.

## 🌟 Goal
To become a confident **Full Stack Developer** who builds scalable, microservice-based web apps — and stays curious forever. 💪
